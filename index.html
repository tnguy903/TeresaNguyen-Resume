        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year Biochemistry major student in the University of California Riverside. I have taken and completed general chemistry and biology along with basic computer science. I am also taking physics and organic chemistry along with my second class involving computer science. I am planning to graduate in the year 2023 and then attend medical school to become a doctor. I plan on being a thoracic surgeon which means that I would specialize in surgery on patients that have problems in the chest area like the heart and lungs.  <br><br>

        I have basic first aid training and also know how to take care of outpatients who are recovering from COVID outside of the hospital. I have had first aid training from Red Cross in High School and have renewed it last year. For COVID outpatient, my dad was an outpatient and I was in charge of taking care of him when he was home. Therefore I know what needs to be done like taking the heart rate, respiratory/breathing of the patient (should be 92 and above), temperature, and in one minutes, how many deep breaths does the patient take. The process of which a nurse would check in on the outpatient virtually would be 2 to 3 weeks. Afterward, the patient family would monitor and only call the nurse back if there is a setback.<br><br>

        In high school is where I got most of my experience. I was part of the Red Cross Club for all four years in High School and in those four years, I was part of the club's board member. As a board member for four years, I have handled the club's finances, recruitment, and handling/hosting the blood drive that happened every 8 weeks during the school year. The blood drive would take at least 6 weeks of planning as the teacher needs to cooperate along with getting students to volunteer to donate their blood. Those volunteers would need to meet certain requirements which is part of the board's job to check. My senior year, I worked in a healthcare social work office. There I manage to do paperwork, fix information, translator, and several other jobs that were assigned to me. I worked with workers that were older than me and gained a lot of experience from it. I worked there for the entire summer and each week was focused on a different  task assigned to me by my manager.
